  "releaseNotes": "There are 3,600,600 milliseconds in an hour. Sounds like a lot of time, huh? At eFmFm, we measure every extra millisecond it takes for a page to load. And every day, we have developers who are helping eFmFm load faster, one millisecond at a time. Just like you aren't the same person today that you were a year ago, the eFmFm App continues to improve, hoping to make your life better, millisecond by millisecond. Have a great day!"
